DiceKit is a Swift framework for expressing and evaluating [dice notation][Dice Notation] (e.g., `d20`, `4d6+4`, `3d8×10+2`), which is commonly used in tabletop role-playing games.

[Dice Notation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation

## Features

- [x] Roll dice with arbitrary number of sides (e.g., `d2`, `d7`, `d6538`)
- [x] Evaluate simple dice expressions, including addition, multiplication, and negation operations (e.g. `2d20 + 6(1d5 + 8)`)
- [ ] Evaluate complicated dice expressions, including division, dropping dice, and exploding dice – [#27](https://github.com/TabletopAssistant/DiceKit/issues/27), [#28](https://github.com/TabletopAssistant/DiceKit/issues/28), [#33](https://github.com/TabletopAssistant/DiceKit/issues/33)
- [ ] Determine the probability distribution of an expression and the chance of meeting a goal (e.g. chance of rolling higher than 16 on `1d20 + 8`)  – [#4](https://github.com/TabletopAssistant/DiceKit/issues/4)
- [ ] Parse expressions from strings – [#8](https://github.com/TabletopAssistant/DiceKit/issues/8)
- [ ] Detect expressions in strings – [#9](https://github.com/TabletopAssistant/DiceKit/issues/9)
- [x] Comprehensive unit test coverage

## Requirements

- iOS 7.0+ / Mac OS X 10.9+ / watchOS 2.0+
- Xcode 7 Beta 3 (Swift 2.0)

## Installation

### Carthage

Add the following line to your **Cartfile**:

```ruby
github "TabletopAssistant/DiceKit"
```

Then run `carthage update`.

Follow the current instructions in [Carthage's README][carthage-installation]
for up to date installation instructions.

### Manually

1. Add **DiceKit.xcodeproj** to your project's workspace.
2. Build the **DiceKit** scheme. This is needed to get the proper path for the next steps.
3. Link your target with **DiceKit.framework**:

  - **iOS:** Drag **DiceKit.framework** from the **DiceKit/Products** group to the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section of your target’s “General” settings.

  - **OS X:** Drag **DiceKit.framework** from the **DiceKit/Products** group to the “Embedded Binaries” section of your target’s “General” settings.

4. Select the **DiceKit.framework** that is now in your project (most likely in your **Frameworks** group). In the “File Inspector” change the “Location” to “Relative to Build Products”.
